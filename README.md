# COMP0035 2024-25 Computer practicals

This repository contains the practicals for the COMP0035 module for the academic year 2024-25.

## Instructions for using this repository

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine (e.g. in VS Code or PyCharm).
3. Each week, update the repository using the 'Sync fork' button in GitHub to check for changes, if it is out of date
   then select the 'Update branch' button.

## Activity instructions and code files

The `activities` folder contains the activity instructions for each week.

The `src-student` package contains any starter code for each week. You can also use this package to store your own code
that you create during the activities.

One solution to the week's activities will be added to the [tutor_solution directory](src/tutorialpkg/tutor_solution)
the following week. Other solutions will be possible, and some may be better than the solution offered, so don't feel
your code has to match the tutors code!
