# COMP0035 Tutorial 6: Database queries

## Pre-requisite: update the forked tutorial repository

The activities assume that you forked the COMP0035 tutorials repository, cloned it to your computer, and set up a
project with a virtual environment within your IDE (VS Code or PyCharm).

Login to GitHub and navigate to your forked copy of the COMP0035 tutorials repository.

Check whether any changes have been made. For example, the image below shows 1 new commit has been made to the original.

If changes have been made, you will need to update your forked repository.

Click on the "Synch fork" button; and then on "Update branch".

Now, open your IDE (VS Code, PyCharm) and update the local copy of the repository. This assumes you have integrated your
IDE with your GitHub account in week 1. You may be prompted to log in to GitHub before you can carry out the
following.

- In PyCharm try menu option Git > Pull  (or Git > Synch)
- In VS Code click on the source code control icon on the left side panel, then when the source code control pane opens,
  click on the three dots and select Pull (or Synch).

There are other methods, look in the Help for either PyCharm or VSCode.

## Complete the activities
