# Testing with GitHub CoPilot / ChatGPT

There are various ways to use the gen AI tools to support testing.

The following assume you have the CoPilot extension for VS Code or the CoPilot Plugin for Pycharm.

[GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot?tool=jetbrains) explain how to
set up and use CoPilot in PyCharm and VS Code.

- Write clear 'prompts' as docstrings or comments in the code. Move the cursor to the end of the comment and then use
  the instructions for your IDE to invoke CoPilot. Alternatively use the docstring, comment or prompts in ChatGPT.
- In VS Code write tests by going to the code within a `.py` file, for example find a class or function definition, right
  click and select **Copilot** then **Generate Tests**.
- In PyCharm, if CoPilot is enabled, as soon as you start to write the test case PyCharm should prompt a suggestion.

Try using CoPilot or ChatGPT to generate tests for you and compare their code to yours.

Please remember the drawbacks and limitations of gen AI.
