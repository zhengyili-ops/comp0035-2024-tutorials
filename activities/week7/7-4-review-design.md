# 5. Review the design

This is not easy as you are trying to critically evaluate our own work against a general design principle or pattern.

As a starting point, look at the diagram you have created and consider:

- Are the relationships between classes, modules, functions only those that are needed?
- Are the attributes and methods/functions within a class or module cohesive? If not do you need to split them into more
  classes, functions, modules.
- Does the structure seem clear (simple as possible)?
- Would the structure allow you to reuse components in another application?
- Is the same business logic represented in more than one place? If so then remove the duplication.

This is not an exhaustive list of questions. This aspect is challenging!
