# 6. Generative AI in application design

## Tools used

The following tools were tried in relation to this week's activities:

- [Goblin Tools professor](https://goblin.tools/Professor) - for summary explanations of design concepts. Prompts used:

    - `Explain the DRY design principle`
    - `Explain the low coupling design principle`
    - `Explain the high cohesion design principle`
    - `Explain the purpose of a UML class diagram`
    - The responses generated at the time were concise and consistent with teaching materials. Responses were
      illustrated with an example.
- [Microsoft copilot - accessed using UCL account](https://copilot.microsoft.com)

    - The prompt used was: `generate a class diagram from the attached use cases` with the user stories from activity
      7.2 pasted into the chat window.
    - The response is below and includes classes and attributes, and relationships. It did not identify class
      operations (functions).
    - A subsequent prompt was then entered:
      `To what extent does this class diagram meet the principles of low coupling and high cohesion?` and again the
      response is below.
- [chatGPT - free 'everyday tasks' version](https://chatgpt.com)

    - the same prompt was used as for copilot. The result included methods as well as classes and attributes,
      and relationships between classes.
    - ChatGPT offered to draw this as a diagram but the result was not meaningful.
    - A second prompt was used:
      `To what extent does this class diagram meet the principles of low coupling and high cohesion?`. The response to
      this was detailed and is included below.
    - A third prompt was used:
      `Modify the design so that it is consistent with the model view controller design pattern`. Again the response is
      below.

As a learning outcome, it is recommended that you first attempt the activities without using gen AI tools as you need to
learn the technique before you can critically judge the output of a gen AI tool. Comparing your own work to the response
of a gen AI tool may give suggested areas where you could review your design.

### Critically review the design

The class diagram you've provided generally adheres to the principles of low coupling and high cohesion, which are
essential for creating maintainable and scalable software systems. Let's break down how it meets these principles:

#### Low Coupling

Low coupling refers to minimizing dependencies between classes, making the system more modular and easier to maintain.

- **User and its subclasses (Student, Teacher, SystemAdministrator)**: These classes are well-separated, with each
  subclass inheriting from the User class. This inheritance structure reduces direct dependencies between different
  types of users.
- **Quiz and Question**: The relationship between Quiz and Question is clear and direct, with each quiz containing
  multiple questions. This relationship is necessary and does not introduce unnecessary dependencies.
- **Score**: The Score class acts as an intermediary between Student and Quiz, which helps in decoupling the direct
  relationship between these two classes. This design allows changes in the Quiz or Student class without significantly
  impacting the other.
- **ParalympicGame and Event**: The one-to-many relationship between ParalympicGame and Event is straightforward and
  necessary for representing the data structure, maintaining low coupling.

#### High Cohesion

High cohesion means that a class should have a single, well-defined responsibility and all its methods and properties
should be closely related to that responsibility.

- **User and its subclasses**: Each subclass (Student, Teacher, SystemAdministrator) has a specific role and
  responsibility, ensuring high cohesion within each class.
- **Quiz, Question, and Answer**: These classes are highly cohesive as they each have a clear, focused responsibility.
  The Quiz class manages quizzes, the Question class handles individual questions, and the Answer class deals with
  possible answers.
- **Score**: The Score class is cohesive as it solely manages the relationship between students and their quiz scores.
- **ParalympicGame and Event**: These classes are cohesive, with ParalympicGame managing overall game information and
  Event handling specific event details.

#### Summary

Overall, the class diagram demonstrates a good balance of low coupling and high cohesion. Each class has a clear
responsibility, and dependencies between classes are minimized where possible. This design should facilitate easier
maintenance and scalability of the system.

### Critically review the diagram

The response to the prompt
`To what extent does this class diagram meet the principles of low coupling and high cohesion?` was:

This class diagram aligns reasonably well with the principles of low coupling and high cohesion, which are essential for
creating maintainable and scalable software systems. Here's an evaluation:

1. Low Coupling
   Low coupling refers to minimizing dependencies between classes, making changes in one class less likely to impact
   others.

Strengths:

- Separation of Concerns: The diagram separates responsibilities into distinct classes like User, Quiz, Question,
  Answer,
  and ParalympicsData. Each class handles a specific part of the functionality, reducing dependencies.
- Inheritance Structure: The inheritance hierarchy (User -> Student, Teacher, Admin) cleanly encapsulates role-specific
  behaviors without excessive interdependencies.
- Aggregations: Classes like Quiz aggregate Question, and Question aggregates Answer. These relationships reflect
  logical
  ownership without unnecessary tight coupling.
- Filters as an Independent Class: Filters is decoupled from ParalympicsData, allowing flexibility in defining or
  extending filtering criteria without altering the data model.

Weaknesses:

- Quiz-Question Relationship: While the aggregation is logical, if changes to Question's structure are frequent, it
  might
  indirectly affect Quiz.
- Dependencies on User Subclasses: Both Student and Teacher depend on the parent User class for shared functionality. If
  changes to the User class are poorly designed, they could propagate unintended effects.
- QuizScore Dependencies: The QuizScore class ties Student and Quiz directly. If either changes significantly, this
  class
  could become a bottleneck.

2. High Cohesion
   High cohesion ensures that each class has a well-defined purpose and that its responsibilities are closely related.

Strengths:

- Role-Specific Behavior: The Student, Teacher, and Admin classes each focus on their specific roles, encapsulating
  behavior like quiz participation (Student), quiz management (Teacher), and data updates (Admin).
- Clear Functionality in Core Classes:
    - Quiz manages only quiz-related behavior like adding and removing questions.
    - Question focuses on managing answers and scoring.
    - ParalympicsData encapsulates event-specific functionalities like statistics and chart generation.
- Single Responsibility Principle: Most classes (e.g., Answer, Filters) have a single, well-defined responsibility,
  ensuring high cohesion.

Weaknesses:

- Overlap in Methods for Student and Teacher: Both roles need to access the quiz system. Some overlap in behavior (e.g.,
  using quizzes) could indicate that cohesion is not fully optimized.
- ParalympicsData Complexity: The ParalympicsData class combines responsibilities for managing raw data, generating
  statistics, and visualizing trends. Breaking this into smaller, more focused classes (e.g., a ChartGenerator) could
  improve cohesion.

Suggestions for Improvement

- Enhance Decoupling:
    - Introduce interfaces or abstract classes for shared behaviors in Quiz and Question to isolate dependencies.
    - Decouple QuizScore by using dependency injection or an observer pattern for managing score updates.
- Increase Cohesion:
    - Split ParalympicsData into:
        - DataManager for managing updates and raw data.
        - StatisticsGenerator for statistical analysis.
        - ChartGenerator for visualizations.
    - Consolidate shared quiz-related methods in a helper or service class to reduce redundancy between Student and
      Teacher.

Conclusion:

This class diagram provides a strong foundation with reasonable low coupling and high cohesion, especially for a small
to medium-sized system. With some refinements, it can achieve even better adherence to these principles.

## Modify the design to conform to MVC

Prompt: `Modify the design so that it is consistent with the model view controller design pattern`

### Response

To align the system with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, we can reorganize the architecture into three
key layers:

1. Model: Represents the data and business logic.
2. View: Handles the presentation of data to users (e.g., GUI or web interface).
3. Controller: Manages user input, updates the model, and selects views.

#### Revised Class Design

1. Model Layer

This layer contains the core business logic and data structures.

Classes:

- User: Represents users and their roles.
- Student, Teacher, Admin: Subclasses of User, encapsulating role-specific data.
- Quiz, Question, Answer: Represent the quiz system's structure and logic.
- QuizScore: Stores quiz scores.
- ParalympicsData: Manages event-related data.
- Filters: Represents filtering criteria for data analysis.

3. View Layer

This layer handles how data is displayed to the user. It should be decoupled from the underlying model.

Classes:

- DashboardView: Displays the main dashboard for students, teachers, or admins.
- QuizView: Handles the presentation of quiz questions and results.
- StatisticsView: Displays statistical information and charts.
- AuthenticationView: Manages login and authentication screens.

4. Controller Layer

This layer processes user inputs, interacts with the model, and updates the views.

Classes:

- UserController: Manages user authentication and role-based actions.
- QuizController: Handles quiz-related operations, such as starting a quiz, submitting answers, and retrieving scores.
- StatisticsController: Manages requests for data and chart generation.
- AdminController: Oversees database updates and administrative actions.

#### Updated Class Relationships

Controller-to-Model Interaction:

- Controllers interact with model classes to retrieve or update data.
- Example: QuizController interacts with Quiz and QuizScore to manage quiz functionality.

Controller-to-View Interaction:

- Controllers pass data to views for rendering.
- Example: QuizController updates QuizView with current questions and user scores.

Decoupling:

- Views never directly interact with models, ensuring clear separation of concerns.

#### MVC Class Diagram

Here’s how the updated structure would look:

Model Classes:

1. User

    - Attributes: userId, name, email, role
    - Methods: login(), logout()
2. Student, Teacher, Admin (inherit from User).
3. Quiz

    - Attributes: quizId, title, questions
    - Methods: addQuestion(), removeQuestion()
4. Question

    - Attributes: questionId, text, options, score
    - Methods: addAnswer(), editAnswer()
5. Answer, QuizScore, ParalympicsData, Filters (unchanged from original design).

View Classes:

1. DashboardView

    - Methods: renderDashboard()
2. QuizView

    - Methods: displayQuestion(), showResult()

3. StatisticsView

    - Methods: renderChart()

4. AuthenticationView

    - Methods: renderLoginForm(), displayError()

Controller Classes:

1. UserController
    - Methods: authenticateUser(), routeToDashboard()
2. QuizController
    - Methods: startQuiz(), submitAnswer(), viewScores()
3. StatisticsController
    - Methods: fetchData(), generateChart()
4. AdminController
    - Methods: updateDatabase()

Benefits of MVC in This Design

1. Separation of Concerns:
    - Views are only responsible for displaying data.
    - Controllers handle all logic, interacting with models to fetch or update data.
    - Models encapsulate the business logic and data without worrying about the presentation.
2. Flexibility:
    - Views can be easily swapped out or updated (e.g., adding mobile-friendly views).
    - Controllers can adapt to changes in user workflows without altering the models.
3. Scalability:
    - Adding new functionality (e.g., new types of views or user roles) becomes straightforward.
