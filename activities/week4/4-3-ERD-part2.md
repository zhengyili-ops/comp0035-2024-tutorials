# 3. ERD solution

This is the solution generated by Mermaid GPT. Do you agree with this, does it address the needs of the data? Is your
ERD different?

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Event {
        int EventID PK
        string Type
        int Year
        date StartDate
        date EndDate
        int Duration
    }

    Country {
        string CountryCode PK
        string CountryName
    }

    HostCity {
        int CityID PK
        string CityName
        string CountryCode FK
    }

    EventParticipants {
        int EventID FK
        int MaleParticipants
        int FemaleParticipants
        int TotalParticipants
    }

    SportEvents {
        int EventID FK
        int NumCountries
        int NumEvents
        int NumSports
    }

    Country ||--o{ HostCity: hosts
    HostCity ||--|| Event: hosts
    Event ||--o{ EventParticipants: has
    Event ||--o{ SportEvents: includes
```

This is a solution based on the text in the previous activity. Note that:

- the 'Participant' and 'EventDetail' tables are not strictly necessary but included based on the last activity that
  asked you to add 2 further possible tables
- the 'Participant' and 'EventDetail' table rows can be uniquely identified by the 'event_id' which can act as both PK
  and FK, or you could choose to add another field to act as the PK as is shown in the 'Participants' table

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Event {
        int event_id PK
        int host_id FK
        int type
        int year
        date start
        date end
        int duration
    }

    Country {
        string country_code PK
        string country
    }

    Host {
        int host_id PK
        string country_code FK
        string host
    }

    HostEvent {
        int host_event_code PK
        int country_code FK
        int event_code FK
    }

    Participants {
        int participant_id PK
        int event_id FK
        int participants_m
        int participants_f
        int participants
    }

    EventDetail {
        int event_id FK, PK
        int countries
        int events
        int sports
    }

    Event ||--o{ HostEvent: "hosted by"
    Host ||--o{ HostEvent: hosts
    Host }o--|| Country: "is in"
    Participants ||--|| Event: "participates in"
    EventDetail ||--|| Event: ""
```
