# 4. Requirements prioritisation

## Why prioritise?

Once you have your initial list of documented requirements, decide how to prioritise them.

Further, the number of requirements exceeds the number of features that can be implemented within the given time and
available resources (people, funding, etc.). Prioritizing requirements helps teams focus on the most important features
first. Not all requirements will deliver the same impact or benefit. Typically, those that generate the most business
value are given a higher priority.

Business value is not the only factor considered, risk, technical complexity, and other factors can also be considered.

## Prioritisation methods

There are numerous techniques for prioritising techniques such as:

- [MoSCoW](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/introduction-to-moscow-prioritization)
- [Forced pair ranking](https://www.lynda.com/Project-Management-tutorials/Forced-ranking-prioritization/471658/585113-4.html)
- [Story mapping](https://jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/)
- [100 points / $100 method](http://www.modernanalyst.com/Careers/InterviewQuestions/tabid/128/ID/2122/How-is-the-100-point-method-used-to-prioritize-requirements.aspx)

### MoSCoW prioritisation

MoSCoW is a widely used approach, though other techniques may be more relevant for user stories such as forced pair
ranking.

The [MoSCoW technique](https://www.agilebusiness.org/dsdm-project-framework/moscow-prioririsation.html) uses a simple
categorisation for requirements:

*M*ust have: These requirements that are absolutely critical to the product/project's success.

*S*hould have: These requirements are also important, but may not be as time-sensitive or vital as the “must have”
requirements.

*Co*uld have: These requirements are nice to have and would make a great addition to the project, but are not critical.
If there’s time, consider adding these in.

*W*on't have for now: The value of these requirements is sufficiently low compared to the time, energy, or budget
needed. They could be considered at a later time.

There are limitations to using MoSCoW. While MoSCoW helps with organizing the categories by importance, it doesn't
provide a way to determine priorities within each of the categories. Relying only on the MoSCoW method, you could
unintentionally ignore critical dependencies and the interrelationship between features.

## Activity: Prioritise the user stories

Consider each of the user stories and assign the most appropriate categorisation (Must, Should, Could, Won't).

Look at your prioritised list. Of those in the 'Must' which would you work on first?

There is no 'correct' answer. Prioritisation is a judgement in a given set of circumstances by one or more people.
