# 1. Project overview

There is no coding in this session. It is a learning activity to learn to document requirements and wireframes.

It is not an exemplar for the coursework. The examples are partial solutions only.

The theme of paralympics is continued based on the paralympics dataset from earlier tutorials.

## Consider what you already know

By this stage you would have some understanding of what the project, or product, is about. You may have one or more of:

- Problem statement
- Product vision or definition
- Goals/objectives
- Questions to answer from the data
- Persona, or other description of the target audience

From these:

- You may be able to identify groups of functionality that the system should achieve from the product vision
  or goals.
- The questions to be answered using the dataset may help to guide the requirements for visualisations in a dashboard.
- The persona might inform the requirements if there is information on current frustrations or goals. Its main use in
  requirements is likely to be in trying to consider from the persona's perspective what the web app needs to do. The
  persona represents the main user base of your application, also consider if there are others who will use the app
  as they may have different needs.

## Paralympics project

Two project ideas are used in the tutorial.

| Target audience | UK school pupils aged 11 to 16. These students are used to using mobile phones and web based apps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| App overview    | A web app with a quiz feature for students, information pages, charts and an area for teachers to enter questions. It uses the existing paralympics data set and will also collect new data (teacher questions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Scenario        | Students have been asked to research facts about the paralympic games. They will use the data they find to generate fact files. Their tutor has asked them as part of their research to find out about: <ul><li>The types of sports that take place in both summer and winter paralympic events</li><li>How the number of men and women competitors in the events has changed over time</li><li>Where the events have taken place?</li></ul>Students will do most of their work during lessons and will be using the app on the school's computers to find out information that they will then use in their own fact files. Students want to copy charts and facts from the app. Students enjoy competition and want to do well in the online quiz. |

| Target audience | UK school pupils aged 16 to 18. These students are used to using mobile phones and web based apps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| App overview    | A web app that includes a machine learning prediction algorithm to predict country medal results in future paralympic games. Historical medal rankings will be included in the app. The app will use the paralympics dataset medal rankings; and a machine learning model trained on the dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Scenario        | Students have been asked to learn about the medal rankings in previous paralympic games, and to make predictions for the next paralympic games including: <ul><li>How will the UK perform?</li><li>Which countries will be in the top 10?</li><li>Which country will win the most gold medals?</li></ul>They will use the app to research historical medal tables, and then use a prediction page to generate answers to the questions. They expect to use the app on their mobile phones. |

## Optional: gen-AI activity to create a persona

Personas can help to guide the design of an app to ensure it meets the needs and interests of the intended target
audience. You are not asked to generate a persona in the coursework, yet it may be useful to you. Personas were covered
in week 2 of the course.

Try using a gen AI tool to generate a persona based on the target audience of one of the scenarios. For example, try
this prompt for the quiz app project:

```text
Generate a persona for a UK school student aged 11-16. This is for a project to design and develop a web app with statistics and information about paralympic games.
```
