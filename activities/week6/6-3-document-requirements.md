# 3. Document requirements

## Approaches to documenting requirements

Select a structure to formally record the requirements. The two options likely to be of most use for this
course are:

- User stories
- Functional and non-function requirements

Consider if there is a format that better suite the nature of your project/product. For example, User Stories would be
expected if you are following an overall Agile approach to the project.

### User story format

Most agile methods use the user story format.

The basic user story template is:

**As a `_role_`, I want `_goal_` so that `_benefit_`.**

Acceptance criteria, or tests, are often added to the user story to clarify the definition. This is one way of adding
non-functional requirements (or 'constraints') to user stories.

For example:
<hr>
As a website user, I want search functionality to be available on all pages so that I can search for books using keywords.

Acceptance criteria:

1. Search box should accept alphanumeric values
2. Search results should display 10 items per page
3. System responds to all search requests within 2 seconds of receiving the request

<hr>

User stories are not typically classified as functional/non-functional. In some cases the non-functional requirements
may be covered by the acceptance criteria; other times you will
see [user stories written for the non-functional needs](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/non-functional-requirements-as-user-stories)
such as:

> "As a customer, I want to be able to run your product on all versions of Windows from Windows 95 on."

### Functional and non-functional requirements

![Natural language specification](../img/nat_lang_spec.png)


Each requirement should focus on a single distinct feature or behaviour and should be written in the same uniform
sentence structure. They should not be too vague or abstract; too general or imprecise; or include implementation
information. e.g. "32 The ATM system shall validate the PIN"

You will typically see these listed in a table format, and they may be grouped in some way e.g.

## Document the quiz app requirements as user stories

The following is a potential list of user stories for the quiz app based on the mindmap.

## Adding detail to user stories

User stories are typically written with just enough detail and act as placeholders for later conversations.

Detail may be added following these conversations, usually just before the 'sprint' or 'iteration' in which the user
story will be developed. Such detail is also likely to be useful when you later start testing.

This further detail can be added using 'acceptance criteria' or 'constraints' to the user story.

> Activity: Add detail to a few of the following user stories.
